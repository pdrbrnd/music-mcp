## What I Like in Music

- **Rhythm**: Hypnotic grooves, polyrhythms, organic percussion
- **Production**: Clean, spacious production with attention to detail
- **Energy**: Medium to low energy - I prefer contemplative over aggressive
- **Vocals**: Minimal or no vocals preferred; if vocals, they should be integrated as an instrument
- **Organic sounds**: Real instruments mixed with electronic elements

## What I DON'T Like

- Hard/aggressive EDM or dubstep
- Top 40 pop
- Over-produced commercial music
- Excessive vocals or cheesy lyrics
- Predictable song structures

## Contexts I Use Music For

1. **Deep Focus / Coding** (40% of listening)
   - Minimal, repetitive patterns
   - No jarring changes
   - 90-120 BPM
   - Examples: Microhouse, minimal techno, ambient

2. **Cooking / Household** (30% of listening)
   - Uplifting but not distracting
   - World music influences
   - Organic sounds
   - 100-130 BPM

3. **Evening Wind-Down** (20% of listening)
   - Downtempo, ambient
   - Emotional but not sad
   - Piano and strings welcome
   - Under 100 BPM

4. **Background / Reading** (10% of listening)
   - Pure ambient
   - No vocals
   - No strong rhythm
   - Drifting soundscapes

## Example Tracks That Define My Taste

- "Fizheuer Zieheuer" - Villalobos (perfect microhouse groove)
- "Cumbia del Mar" - Nicola Cruz (organic, percussive, world fusion)
- "Open Eye Signal" - Jon Hopkins (intricate, emotional electronic)
- "All Melody" - Nils Frahm (neo-classical electronic perfection)
- "Breathe" - Floating Points (hypnotic, building tension)
- "Intro" - The xx (minimal, intimate, atmospheric)

## Discovery Preferences

When recommending music:
- Prioritize lesser-known artists and deep cuts over obvious choices
- Consider the mix of energy and mood carefully
- Explain WHY a track fits (don't just list tracks)
- Balance familiarity with discovery (70% new, 30% related to what I know)
- Consider the listening context I mention

## Current Playlists

- **Focus**: Microhouse and minimal techno for coding
- **Moody**: Downtempo, atmospheric, melancholic
- **World Kitchen**: Latin and African rhythms for cooking
- **Sunday Morning**: Ambient and neo-classical for lazy mornings
